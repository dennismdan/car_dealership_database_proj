- Sales
Vehicles are bought by customers via a salesperson. The list price is calculated as 125% of the
invoice price, however, customers can negotiate and receive a lower price, which is recorded at
the time of sale (the “sold price”). Market conditions may also enable a salesperson to sell a
vehicle at a higher price. The system should store the details of customer who purchased the
vehicle, and it’s possible (and good for business) that a buyer can purchase several vehicles.
Should a buyer purchase several vehicles at the same time, they would still be handled as

separate sales transactions. The purchase date should be tracked to determine when a vehicle
leaves inventory.
